### What I learned

To be honest, it wasn’t an easy project. At first, I struggled with styling SVG images in CSS. But now, I can say I fully understand it, which was a good experience for me.

The JavaScript side was quite fun. I had done a similar project before, but I still had to do a lot of research on Stack Overflow. I guess that’s a normal part of the process. Unfortunately, information that I don’t use doesn’t stay fresh in my mind.

The most challenging part was deciding which method to use for getting letters and numbers. Initially, I wanted to use the fromCharCode function, but I couldn’t achieve exactly what I wanted. Instead, I made each character into an array, which worked.

Similarly, it took me a while to come up with the idea of making the colors and different strengths of colors into objects.

To make the project look a bit more realistic, I also added an animation and an error statement.
